# HR Cohortinator
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta) during a 2-day solo sprint as a means to experiment with Angular2 (beta) and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node ^4.2.3, npm ^2.14.7

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to run both the server and the compiler (to convert TypeScript files to JavaScript files), both in "watch" mode
3. Run `npm run tsc` to run the TypeScript compiler once
4. Run `npm tsc:w` to run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode which keeps an eye out for any changes to TypeScript files and recompiles them as necessary
5. Run `npm run lite` to run the lite-server, a light-weight, static file server with support for Angular apps that use routing
6. Run `npm typings` to run the typings tool
7. Run `npm run postinstall` is called by npm automatically after it successfully completes package installation.
